 We proposed an Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN) for Node Importance Ranking in Complex Networks

Usage

--The code is tested on python3.7 and tensorflow1.13.1.

--The model of ICAN can be found in 'ICAN_model.py'. Besides, we provide an example on a synthetic dataset which can be found in 'synthetic_dataset.py'.

--The datasets used in the experiments are provided in the datasets folder.

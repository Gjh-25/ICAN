Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network for Node Importance Ranking in Complex Networks
Introduction
We proposed an influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN) for Node Importance Ranking in Complex Networks.

Usage
--The code is tested on python3.7 and tensorflow1.13.1.
--The model of ICAN can be found in 'ican_model.py'. Besides, we provide an example on a synthetic dataset which can be found in 'synthetic_dataset.py'.
